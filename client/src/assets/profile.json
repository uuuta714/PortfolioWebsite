I used Excel VBA to automate tasks, which made me realize the power of technology in making work more efficient. This sparked my interest in software development. I wanted to do more than just use Excelâ€”I wanted to build tools and applications that could make a bigger impact. So, I pursued a Master's degree in Information Technology, focusing on software development. Now, I'm excited to use my skills to create software that helps businesses run more smoothly and effectively.",
